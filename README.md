@Ben-Benevolent
My interest in GitHub stems from a desire to learn how my code can be made better, more useful, safer and more interesting.
I’m currently learning about C++, specifically how to make graphic user interfaces in Windows for CRUDS which serve to assist in mathematical or coding 
projects, but I would also like trying to make games some time.
I would like to collaborate on a project, but i currently do not know what I would like to collaborate on. I would also like to venture into programming
langauges other than C++, such as Haskell and Carbon (when that is relased). I have spent a breif period dipping my toes into Prolog and Forth, and found
important lessons from the both, as well as x86 assembly (for manual debugging).

I can be contacted at ashley.ben.story@gmail.com
